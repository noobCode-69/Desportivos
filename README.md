# DESPORTIVOS (College Sports Annual Fest Website)
This project is a website for a college sports annual fest. I worked as a tech team lead for this project.

The website contains the following pages:

1) Home page
2) Contact page
3) Sponsors page
4) Teams page
5) Registration page

The website is made purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also used GSAP for animation. The registration page uses the Google App Script feature to store data in an Excel file.

# Home Page
The home page contains information about the college sports annual fest, such as the date and location of the event, as well as a brief introduction to the event.
# Sponsors Page
The sponsors page contains a list of all the sponsors for the event. 

# Teams Page
The teams page contains information about all the Members that made the fest possible.
# Registration Page
The registration page is where visitors can register for the event. We used the Google App Script feature to store the registration data in an Excel file. This allows the organizers to easily keep track of all the registered participants.
# Deployment
The webisite is currently live and can be accessed on [Desportivos](https://desportivos.lnmiit.ac.in)

# Conclusion
Overall, the College Sports Annual Fest Website was a challenging but rewarding project to work on. As the tech team lead, I was responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the website functioned smoothly and that the design was visually appealing. We used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and engaging website that successfully promoted the event.
